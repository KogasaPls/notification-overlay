# Notification Panel
This is a RuneLite plugin that displays notifications in an overlay panel. It is much more useful than native notifications when using multiple clients, and it's OS-agnostic.

## Features / Options

* The notification panel can be repositioned and locked to anchors like any other overlay panel. 

* The width of the notifications can be adjusted by alt-clicking on a border and dragging. 

* The maximum number of notifications shown at once can range from 1 to 5.

* The expiration time can be toggled.

* The duration each notification lasts can be changed. Setting the duration to 0ms will make notifications last forever (or until it is replaced by newer notifications). In this case, the "show time" setting will show the age of the notification.

* The font can be adjusted between "small," "regular," and "bold."

* Shift-right clicking a notification will show a "Clear" option which will clear all notifications.

* The background color and opacity can be adjusted. If you want, you can adjust the background color for different messages independently: put a regular expression on each line of the "Regex" field, and a hex code (like "#FF0000") in the "Colors" field.
